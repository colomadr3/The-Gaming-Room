# The-Gaming-Room
Project submission for CS230

The Gameing Room tasked our software development firm with setting up the environment of a web-based version of their mobile game "Draw It or Lose It" to serve multiple platforms and to facilitate its development. The requirements were that the application can have multiple games but allow for only one instance to exist in memory at any given time. A game must have the ability to support one or multiple teams and each team can consist of one or more players. Game and team names must be unique. The Game application will check validity of game/team names on creation.

The player managment and validation checks using REST APIs were cleanly integrated. It added an extra layer of security allowing users to login to their created accounts and with the correct assigned roles. The APIs allow for a more modular and portable code utilizing the lightweight and streamlined architecture.

Documenting the development process was very helpful for the application creation. It helped to define expectations and log progress to ensure the needs of the Gaming Room were met. Evaluating the characteristics (strengthes and weaknesses) for each of the different operating platforms helped to understand the importance of choosing the right platform to start development. In many ways they are similar, but its their differences that determine how smooth development will be.

I would revise the operating platform evalutions. I understand there is a wealth of knowledge for each of the platforms. I would like to do justice to their advantages/disadvantages. I know I could do a deeper dive into each of the operating platforms to research each one and expand on why/how it would be beneficial to use.

The user experience is crucial when developing software, just ask Apple. You want to ensure you are satisfying the needs of your client, but also your users. If it is not simple and easy to use, the users can get frustrated and look for a different application to meet their needs. Luckily UX/UI was simple for the Game Room. It was established in the original mobile app and we just needed to create an environment to have it supported on other platforms.

Definitely start development with writing a Software Design Document. That way I can list the requirements and constraints of a project and see the entire picture. Before I would just start writing code and figure it out as I go, but by writing a Software Design Document, I can save myself a lot of time and headaches.
